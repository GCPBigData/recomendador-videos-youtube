Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into a mode of self-learning without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. So, put simply, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use “pattern recognition” to produce reliable results. Machine learning is starting to reshape how we live, and it’s time we understood what it is and why it matters. Now, let us deep dive into this short video and understand the basics of Machine Learning.

Below topics are explained in this Machine Learning basics video:
1. What is Machine Learning? ( 00:21 )
2. Types of Machine Learning ( 02:43 )
2. What is Supervised Learning? ( 02:53 )
3. What is Unsupervised Learning? ( 03:46 )
4. What is Reinforcement Learning? ( 04:37 )
5. Machine Learning applications ( 06:25 )

Alexander has some of the most in-depth data science projects I've seen. These are great case studies for anyone looking to up their game. 

Links Mentioned

Danny's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGYPQz_qySbPESTK8k2ky5g
Alexander's Website: https://alexander-kahanek.github.io/

Portfolio:
- Very nice web layout
- Maybe keep it to one scrollable page
- Love the about me, perfect place to put it and cute dog
- Cool to see someone pursuing this career after going back to school
- Key thing is he is transitioning, not jumping
- No age for data science

Resume 
- I like the digital resume, but maybe a pdf or picture of a traditional one would make more sense here
- I don't love the *** scale. For me this is usually a box to check (Can he do this, we will find out his aptitude later) One thing I've found is that people have no clue how to judge their own ability
- More expansion on the types of skills
- Love how he talks about his projects and what he is doing
- Don't see a need for the soft skills section

Linkedin 
- More connections

About the course 

Python has been one of the premier, flexible, and powerful open-source language that is easy to learn, easy to use, and has powerful libraries for data manipulation and analysis. For over a decade, Python has been used in scientific computing and highly quantitative domains such as finance, oil and gas, physics, and signal processing. 

Edureka's Python Certification Training not only focuses on the fundamentals of Python, Statistics and Machine Learning but also helps one gain expertise in applied Data Science at scale using Python. The training is a step by step guide to Python and Data Science with extensive hands-on. The course is packed with several activity problems and assignments and scenarios that help you gain practical experience in addressing predictive modeling problems that would either require Machine Learning using Python. Starting from basics of Statistics such as mean, median and mode to exploring features such as Data Analysis, Regression, Classification, Clustering, Naive Bayes, Cross-Validation, Label Encoding, Random Forests, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines with a supporting example and exercise help you get into the weeds. 

Furthermore, you will be taught of Reinforcement Learning which in turn is an important aspect of Artificial Intelligence. You will be able to train your machine based on real-life scenarios using Machine Learning Algorithms.

Edureka’s Python course will also cover both basic and advanced concepts of Python like writing Python scripts, sequence and file operations in Python. You will use libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit, and master concepts like Python machine learning, scripts, and sequence.

Why learn Python?

It's continued to be a favorite option for data scientists who use it for building and using Machine learning applications and other scientific computations.

You might wonder, what is R, and why you should learn R programming?
Well, R is a popular programming language adopted for data science and statistics, and The R programming language is used by professionals and data experts around the world for mapping marketing trends, modelling financial data, and so on.

And the best thing is, R programming language is free. R is an open-source statistical programming language supported by a community. R is also called the language for statistical computing. 

R runs on almost any computing platform and operating system. 
R provides a rich collection of statistical techniques or functions and has sophisticated graphical and visualization capabilities for plots and graphs. This language also provides a complex and sophisticated visualization of high-dimensional data. Another very important feature of R is that it is highly extensible. 

R language is not strictly in the sense only for statistics but also for advance mathematical modelling and machine learning.  This introduction to R course is the best way to start learning R programming and getting handy with its features. 

In this course, we will cover the R’s basics and programming fundamentals. Eventually, you will learn how to use R’s data structures such as Vectors, Matrices, Lists and Data frames. 

Each of these sections includes a screencast of hands-on implementation and is also accompanied by short quizzes. Finally, we will look at how to import data from various sources, and how to handle data large data. 

And on top of that in this course, we will move deeper into the graphical capabilities of R and learn how to create visualizations which will help in analysis.

In the end, we will perform basic statistical analysis on specifically designed stock price datasets to get the real feel of R’s statistical computing capabilities.

Detailed video description! (timeline can be found in comments)

We start by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:
- Drop NaN values from DataFrame
- Removing rows based on a condition
- Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section. In this section we explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:
- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
- What city sold the most product?
- What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customer’s buying product?
- What products are most often sold together?
- What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:
- Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
- Adding columns
- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
- Using the .apply() method
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
- Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
- Labeling our graphs

It wouldn’t matter if you just tell them how much you know if you have nothing to show them! That’s where most people struggle and miss out.

You might have worked on several problems before, but if you can’t make it presentable & easy-to-explain, how on earth would someone know what you are capable of? 

That’s where these projects will help you. Think of the time you’ll spend on these projects like your training sessions. 

The more time you spend practicing, the better you’ll become!

The field of data analytics is quite large and what you might be aiming to do with it is likely to never match up exactly to any tutorial. With that in mind, I think the best way for us to approach learning data analysis with Python is simply by example. My plan here is to find some datasets and do some of the common data analysis tasks, using the Pandas package, to hopefully get you familiar enough with the package to work with it on your own.

Let me know if you have any questions!

In this video we walk through many of the fundamental concepts to use the Python Pandas Data Science Library. We start off by installing pandas and loading in an example csv. We then look at different ways to read the data. Read a column, rows, specific cell, etc. Also ways to read data based on conditioning. We then move into some more advanced ways to sort & filter data. We look at making conditional changes to our data. We also start doing aggregate stats using the groupby function. We finished the video talking about how you would work with a very large dataset (many gigabytes)

I realized as I upload this video there are some additional things I want to talk about in a later video. The first thing that comes to mind immediately is using the apply() function on a dataframe to alter the data using a custom or lambda function. If you have questions on this or anything else before I get around to making  a part 2, feel free to write me a note in the comments.

A good understanding of customers is extremely important for running a successful business. KYC or ‘know your customer’ is what actually makes all the difference for many companies. KYC helps them do their best in creating, communicating, and delivering their offerings by tailoring them to their customers’ needs. 

But understanding and meeting customers’ needs is easier said than done. Customer Analytics is a very broad area. It may include a wide range of characteristics of customers and their behavior and numerous different outcomes and performance indicators that the business might be interested in.

In this introductory course we will focus on the first part of one of the most fundamental marketing frameworks – that of segmentation, targeting, and positioning, known as the ‘S T P framework’.

The data we’ll use throughout the course come from a fast-moving consumer goods, or ‘F M C G’ company. A typical example of an ‘F M C G’ marketplace is a supermarket.  People visit supermarkets every day and most types of goods in-store are purchased daily, too. Therefore, we have lots and lots of data available, making ‘F M C G’ a perfect example for our customer analytics course.

Enjoy the course!

The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

Read on or watch the video below to explore more details. Once you’re ready to start competing, click on the ""Join Competition button to create an account and gain access to the competition data. Then check out Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!

The Challenge
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
